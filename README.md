# Learnspace

## What is this?
Basically this is a collection of materials for teaching I prepared for others.  
Inside the `main branch` you only find finalized material. Sometimes only in German, sometimes only in English.  
My main documentation language is English — if you find German materials, they were created for some German natives.

## I'm looking for XYZ...
Try using the search on the top right in GitHub:  
![search.png](search.png)

If you use this string and replace `XYZ` with what you search for, you can see if it's found anywhere in this repo:

```
repo:sora7672/learnspace XYZ
```


If it's not found, I've not taught it — or better, I've not prepared material for it so far.  
Feel free to DM me on Discord if you want to learn stuff.  
I'm always happy to help, **if I have the capacity** at that time!


## How is this structured?
Each top-level folder represents a **topic** or **subject area**.

Inside every folder (and subfolder), you'll find a `README.md` file.  
When browsing the repository through GitHub's web interface, this file is **automatically displayed** when you open the folder.

Each of these `README.md` files explains the **context** of the folder — what the topic is about, what the files are for, and how to use them.

## Subtopics
- [Java](java/README.md)
- [Python](python/README.md)
- [Mixed](mixed/README.md)
