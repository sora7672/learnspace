## Simple Tasks

1. In this folder, youâ€™ll find several JSON files â€“ all of them contain errors.  
   The higher the number at the beginning of the filename, the more difficult the file.  
   Try to identify and fix the errors.

Best approach: use a plain text editor. IDEs like IntelliJ help you automatically â€“ but that would be a bit too easy ðŸ˜‰

**Solution:**  
Copy the content of the JSON file into `test.json` located in the project root.  
Then run `Tester.readJson();` to check if the file can be read correctly.  
If everything prints nicely â€“ well done!

*Note: Make sure Maven is properly set up!*

2. Create your own JSON file based on a topic that interests you.  
   Examples:

- **Books:** List of titles, authors, and page counts
- **Sports:** Info about your favorite sports club
- **Cooking:** Recipe with ingredients and step-by-step instructions

**Solution:**  
Same as in Task 1.
