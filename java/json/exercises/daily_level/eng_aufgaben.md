## Tasks That Reflect Real Developer Work

1. Create a concept for locally storing shopping carts as JSON.  
   In other words, design a blueprint for the JSON file structure.  
   Our online store includes the following product types and special features:

- T-shirts in various sizes (e.g., XL/L or numerical sizes like 32/36)
- Multiple color options
- Shoes with both EU and UK sizing systems
- Special editions, including different patterns and color combinations
- Skateboard accessories with highly diverse structures (tip: check out titus.de for inspiration)
- Each product can have a discount code applied
- There are also discount codes that apply to entire categories within the cart

**Goal:**  
Design a JSON structure that flexibly covers all of this.  
Pay attention to empty values and correct data types.

Present your structure to your classmates and explain the reasons behind your choices.  
It’s okay if your concept has flaws – feedback is part of the learning process.

> There is no perfect solution. What matters is that you can explain your design decisions.  
> Use nested objects where it makes sense to reflect logical structure and relationships.
