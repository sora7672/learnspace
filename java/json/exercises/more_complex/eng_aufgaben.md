## Tasks That Can Be Mentally Challenging – Depending on Personality

> You probably won't be able to fully complete these tasks with your current level of knowledge.  
> They're aimed at learners who genuinely enjoy challenging themselves and love to tinker.

> If you feel stuck, consider helping other classmates instead –  
> that builds up your stakeholder communication skills. In real-world projects, that's often an underestimated skill.  
> Poor communication between stakeholders and developers frequently leads to duplicated work.

1. Build yourself a module or package that checks:
   - whether a path or file exists
   - whether the file is currently in use
   - whether the file already contains valid JSON  
     Only write new data to the file if the optional flag `override = true` is set.

2. Create a class with attributes that you want to save and load.  
   The class should:
   - include a method to save itself
   - offer a static method that initializes an object based on a file path  
     Each object should receive its own filename.

3. Make sure that a static list of all created instances is maintained.  
   When an object is deleted, it should also be removed from this list.

**Goal:**  
You don’t need to complete everything. What matters is that you hit obstacles and learn from them.  
Discuss your struggles and discoveries with others – that’s how everyone improves.
