## General Notes on the Tasks

For all tasks, the rule is: **You don't have to do them.**  
Itâ€™s completely up to you how you learn best.  
If traditional tasks arenâ€™t your thing, consider creating your own small project instead.

### The Most Important Thing:

Have fun while learning, and embrace moments when you get stuck â€“  
because that means: **Youâ€™re about to learn something new.**

Feeling frustrated?  
Thatâ€™s a sign: **It matters to you!**  
If you push through, youâ€™ll understand the topic **even more deeply.**

> **Donâ€™t compare yourself to others.**  
> Compare yourself to *who you were yesterday.*

And donâ€™t forget:  
If you have questions, just ask!  
Ask your instructor, your teacher, or your fellow learners ðŸ˜Š
