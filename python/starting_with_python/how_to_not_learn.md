# Don't Learn Like This!
*Real Talk about How NOT to Learn Programming*

Learning to code is hard. Most people quit before they ever write a single real line of code.  
Here’s what really holds you back and how to avoid the biggest traps.

## The Most Common Mistakes

#### 1. Tutorial-Hopping
Don’t just binge YouTube, Udemy, or endless blogs. Watching isn’t learning.  
You only feel like you understand until you have to do it yourself.
</br></br>

#### 2. Copy-Paste Without Thinking
If you copy code without changing it, you haven’t learned anything.  
Rename variables, tweak things, break and fix the code. Make it yours.
</br></br>

#### 3. Passive Note-Taking Over Practice
You can make a thousand pages of notes and never actually learn to code.  
Documentation is great for looking things up, but you only learn by doing.
</br></br>

#### 4. Learning While Distracted
If your phone is buzzing or people keep interrupting you, you’ll never reach focus mode.  
Set aside real, distraction-free time for practice.  
(Including, partner, kids and sometimes animals too)  
If you do that, you can spend focus time with others and focus time, where you fast learn shit!
</br></br>

#### 5. Learning Without Application
If you finish a lesson and move on without ever building something yourself, it will all fade away.  
Every concept you learn should be used in a small script, project, or at least a custom example.
</br></br>

#### 6. Staying in Your Comfort Zone
Afraid to try something new or to break things? You’ll stay stuck.  
Don’t be scared of making mistakes. You learn most when you go beyond what you already know.  
**EVERY MISTAKE IS A NEW DATAPOINT!**
</br></br>

#### 7. Faking Understanding of Errors
Don’t just skip over error messages thinking "I kind of get it."  
Write it down. Try to explain it to someone else, or to yourself.  
If you can’t, you don’t really understand it yet.
</br></br>

#### 8. Giving Up When Stuck  
Everyone hits problems that seem unsolvable. It’s normal to feel stuck or even frustrated for days.  
Don’t bang your head against the wall forever. Take a real break!  
Sleep on it, do something else, then come back fresh.  
Try different methods to break through your mental "I don't understand Loop".  
_I like to use **"Explain it to your Grandma who don't know PC stuff"**, helps a ton!_

## Real-World Learning Advice

#### 1. Frustration and Headaches Are Normal   
If you feel mentally exhausted or even get headaches, that’s your brain wiring new connections (like muscle soreness after a workout).  
Take a short break, not a week off, drink enough water (Your body needs it then!) and keep going.  
You’re literally leveling up your brain!
</br></br>

#### 2. Talk to Others, Even Non-Coders  
If you’re stuck, explain your problem out loud to a friend or even to someone who doesn’t code.  
Breaking down the issue for someone else often reveals the real problem and sometimes the solution.

#### 3. Don’t Waste Hours Stuck, Change Perspective* 
If you’re stuck for more than a couple of hours, do something totally different.  
Sometimes the solution comes while you’re walking, observing the world, or even watching how things work in real life.

#### 4. Mistakes Are Part of the Journey  
Nobody gets it right all the time. Every error is a step towards deeper understanding.  
Celebrate your bugs. They’re proof that you’re learning.

#### 5. You Don’t Need to Memorize Everything  
It’s totally normal to Google things or check your notes, even after months.  
The important part is understanding how to use what you find.

#### 6. Mini-Projects Beat Copy-Paste, Every Time  
Don’t just retype what you see. Think of your own (even silly) problems to solve with code.  
That’s where the real learning happens.

## Final Truth

Programming is a bit like going to the gym for your brain.  
Real progress is uncomfortable, sometimes even painful, but it’s always worth it in the end.

Always question everything and ask yourself "why?" That’s how you actually learn.

### Side Story
> **Everyone struggles!**  
> I've seen programmers swapping from JS or Java to Python  
> and making the most basic mistakes over and over. Because? They didn't learn programming before!  
> They memorized their language patterns! Biggest mistake you can do.


> When I created _my first big Python project_, I struggled 14 fucking days on a problem with 3 Frameworks  
> intercepting each other, resulting in a dumb combination of threads which needed to be closed  
> in a specific order. It took 5 lines of code (LOC) to fix only... but over 30 hours to test and figure out.    
> That could be your new "Normal" :'D ...   
> **AND IT'S OK!**
