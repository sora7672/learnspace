# Where Do I Code? (Choosing an IDE)

You can write Python with any text editor, even Notepad on Windows.  
But that’s rarely a good idea for beginners.

Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs at the start of a line) to define its code structure.  
Plain editors make it easy to miss errors. Python is strict about every single space.

There are special tools called IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that make Python easier to read, write, and run.  
Many beginners get frustrated with command lines or basic editors and quit before even writing their first real line of code.

## Why Use an IDE?

**Instant Feedback:**  
Most IDEs highlight mistakes (indentation, typos) before you even run your code.

**One Click Run:**  
Run scripts with a single button. No complex setup, no command line confusion.

**File Organization:**  
Your whole project stays organized in one place.

**Debugging Tools:**  
Good IDEs let you step through code and see exactly what’s happening, making error fixing much easier.

**Customization:**  
Install plugins, change the look and feel, or tailor the environment to your workflow.

**Productivity Features:**  
Auto-complete, refactoring, search/replace, and "go to definition" save time and prevent mistakes.

## Recommended IDEs and Editors

### PyCharm (_by JetBrains_)
My clear favorite. Fast setup, great for beginners and pros.  
Everything works out of the box, and you can run almost any script right inside the IDE.  
Also you can create plugins that work across all Jetbrains IDEs.  
(If you learn one Jetbrains IDE, every other is superfast usable!)

_As of December 2025, there is just one version of PyCharm, both free and pro features combined._  
**If you want to try serious Python work, this is the way to go.**

### VS Code (Visual Studio Code):
Very popular, highly customizable, and supports Python with extensions.  
It's used for cross language programming a lot.  
Therefore it has a few flaws in specific languages and you are tied by using and finding proper plugins.

### Jupyter Notebook: 
Mostly used data science, prototyping, or learning.  
Run code in cells and see results instantly.  
Has the downside, that many things don't run as they would in a normal Python environment.  
For explanation of short scripts it's great.  
For productive code, we recommend one of the above IDEs.  
**Why?**  
You can’t access files as easily, many magic (“dunder”) variables (like `__name__`) don’t behave as expected,
and some imports or features (like command-line arguments or file paths) don’t always work properly.

### Online Editors:  
Sites like Replit, Trinket, or PythonAnywhere let you write and run Python code  
in your browser. Handy if you can’t install anything.  
Also for productive code, we recommend one of the above IDEs.  
**Why?**  
File access is limited, some Python features (including magic/dunder variables) don’t work as expected,
and certain libraries can’t be installed or used. And debugging this is a pain!

## Personal Note

**Most beginners (Around 70%) quit before writing their first real line of code.**  
It’s not that Python is hard. The initial setup just feels overwhelming or confusing.  
A good IDE like PyCharm removes those hurdles.  
Install it, create a project, and you’re ready for **your first “Hello World!” in minutes.**

If you get stuck, don’t worry. Everyone has trouble with setup at first. IDEs are there to make your life easier.

_**Summary:**_  
Start with an IDE (PyCharm recommended) and focus on learning to code.  
You can always try other tools later as you get more comfortable.  
Don't switch between IDEs! It slows down your learning progress significant!  
Every IDE has their own configuration, keybindings and some "hickups" you need to learn.

Reminder:  
**HAVE FUN TRYING TO CODE YOUR WEIRDEST THOUGHTS! :D**
