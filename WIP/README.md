# WIP

Stands for *Work In Progress*.  
This folder is a collection of **unfinished**, **rough**, or **not-yet-polished** materials.

It may include:
- Drafts I'm still refining
- Notes or ideas I plan to turn into real lessons
- Thought scraps I don't want to forget

## What to do with this?
Nothing â€” seriously, **donâ€™t even look at it ðŸ˜„**  
This area is just my personal scratchpad before things get finalized and moved to the `main` branch.
